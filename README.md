# Bye bye Github...

Why do I'm leaving Github ?

> Because I can't live with the idea that Microsoft now owns the biggest place where the open source code is / was hosted.

And ?

> Also because Github didn't took the time to ask us, developpers, users, if we would be ok with this operation and my reply would be **NO!**

# New home

But where could you find my code now ?

> I just moved to Gitlab as many other devs did.

# Gists

My gists will stay on Github for few reasons:

 * Github has a better audience on Google
 * Did not found the same feature with the same visibility on Gitlab

Place of my gists: https://gist.github.com/jiab77

# Projects

I might just keep the projects names on Github too for the same reason as above, but with only the present file and a link to the new project home.

# Repository

The new place is here: https://gitlab.com/jiab77/systemd-zram
